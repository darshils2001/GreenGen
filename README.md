# GreenGen

## What it is

This is a project created for the DubHacks 2020 Hackathon. GreenGen is used to reccomend eco-friendler products for online shoppers to reduce their carbon footprint. GreenGen is a web application as well as an extension for Google Chrome. 

The GreenGen extension automatically provides eco-friendly alternatives to products that online shoppers are looking at and provides the name, description, image and link of each alternative. The GreenGen web application allows users to search for greener products themselves through our extensive database.
